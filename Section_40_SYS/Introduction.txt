DESCRIPTION
    This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
    interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

    Dynamic objects:

    argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
    path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
    modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

    displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
    excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
      To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
      top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.

    stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
    stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
    stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
      By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
      to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

    last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
    last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
    last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
      These three are only available in an interactive session after a
      traceback has been printed.
