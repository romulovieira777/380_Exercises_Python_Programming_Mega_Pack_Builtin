    class Path(PurePath)
     |  Path(*args, **kwargs)
     |
     |  PurePath subclass that can make system calls.
     |
     |  Path represents a filesystem path but unlike PurePath, also offers
     |  methods to do system calls on path objects. Depending on your system,
     |  instantiating a Path will return either a PosixPath or a WindowsPath
     |  object. You can also instantiate a PosixPath or WindowsPath directly,
     |  but cannot instantiate a WindowsPath on a POSIX system or vice versa.
