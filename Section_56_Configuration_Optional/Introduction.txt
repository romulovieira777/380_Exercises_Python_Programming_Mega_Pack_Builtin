Info

This section is optional. If you have a runtime environment set up, you can jump straight to the coding exercises.

However, if you want to go to the environment configuration, below you will learn how to:

work in the cloud with the Google Colab tool

install Anaconda on Windows 10

install Anaconda on Linux (Ubuntu)

Tip:

I recommend doing the exercises in your own editor and copying to the space for the solution.
