Exercise No. 04

Consider the two-roll of the dice. Create the probability space (omega) and calculate the probability of obtaining three
values which the sum is divisible by 7. Use set comprehension. Round the result to two decimal places and print the
result to the console as shown below.

Expected result:

    Probability: 0.14
