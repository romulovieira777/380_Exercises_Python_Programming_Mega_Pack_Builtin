DESCRIPTION
    This module implements specialized container datatypes providing
    alternatives to Python's general purpose built-in containers, dict,
    list, set, and tuple.

    * namedtuple   factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
    * deque        list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
    * ChainMap     dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings
    * Counter      dict subclass for counting hashable objects
    * OrderedDict  dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
    * defaultdict  dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
    * UserDict     wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing
    * UserList     wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing
    * UserString   wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing
